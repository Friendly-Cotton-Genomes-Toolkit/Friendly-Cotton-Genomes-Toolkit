## üöÄ Introduction

**FCGT (Friendly Cotton Genomes Toolkit)** is a genomic data analysis toolkit designed specifically for cotton researchers, especially for scientists and students with a **non-bioinformatics background**. We are committed to encapsulating complex data processing workflows behind a simple graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI), allowing you to use it **out of the box** without tedious environment configuration and coding.

This toolkit provides a series of powerful tools for cotton genome data processing, including homologous gene mapping between different versions (Liftover), gene functional annotation, gene locus query, enrichment analysis, and batch data processing with an AI assistant. It aims to be an indispensable and **reliable** assistant in your daily research work.

## ‚ú® Core Highlights & Features

### 1. Extremely Friendly, Out of the Box

- **Data Security**: No internet connection is required except for data download, AI functions, and update checks, preventing data leakage. The source code is open and subject to community review.
- **GUI First**: All core tools can be operated through an intuitive graphical interface with simple mouse clicks.
- **Interactive Task Feedback**: **All time-consuming operations (like data download, AI processing) have real-time progress bar pop-ups, and you can cancel the task at any time. After the task is completed, you will receive clear success, failure, or cancellation prompts, completely eliminating blind waiting.**
- **Smooth User Experience**: Carefully optimized UI logic ensures instant response for interface switching and **smooth mouse wheel scrolling across all pages**, providing an experience comparable to native desktop applications.
- **Multi-language Support**: Built-in support for Simplified/Traditional Chinese, English, and Japanese interfaces, breaking down language barriers.

### 2. Efficient Automation & Batch Processing

- **Powerful Concurrency & Task Management**: Built-in multi-threading acceleration significantly reduces waiting time, whether you are downloading massive genome data or processing thousands of rows in a table with the AI assistant. Interactive progress pop-ups keep you informed of the task status and allow you to cancel at any time.
- **Smart Configuration Sync**: Changes made in the configuration editor (such as switching AI models) are synchronized to all function pages in real-time without restarting or manual refreshing‚Äîwhat you see is what you get.
- **Command-Line Support**: For advanced users, we also provide a full-featured command-line tool, making it easy to integrate FCGT into your automated analysis pipelines.

### 3. Precise Genomics Toolset

- **Cotton Liftover**: Solves the long-standing problem in the cotton research field of lacking a tool for converting gene lists between different genome versions.
- **All-in-One Data Tools**: Integrates various common functions such as gene annotation, GFF query, enrichment analysis, and format conversion, eliminating the need to switch between multiple software.
- **Standardized Data Download**: One-click download of mainstream cotton reference genomes and annotation files from authoritative databases like [CottonGen](https://www.cottongen.org/).

### 4. Cross-Platform, Available Everywhere

- We provide pre-compiled executables for **Windows** users (users on other systems can run it from Python).
- You will get a consistent and smooth user experience regardless of which mainstream operating system you use.

## Quick Start

We have prepared out-of-the-box executables for you on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/PureAmaya/Friendly-Cotton-Genomes-Toolkit/releases) page, which is the most recommended way to use the toolkit.

- **GUI Version**: Download `FCGT-GUI.exe` (Windows) or the corresponding file for your system and run it by double-clicking.
- **Command-Line Tool**: Download `FCGT.exe` (Windows) or the corresponding file for your system and run it in the terminal.

**Developers and advanced users** can also start from the source code:

```
# Run the GUI
python gui_app.py

# View command-line help
python -m cotton_toolkit.cli --help
